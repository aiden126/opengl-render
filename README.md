A personal C++ project to explore OpenGL and graphics rendering, featuring GLFW for window management, IMGUI for interactive controls, and 3D lighting techniques including point, directional, specular, diffuse, and ambient lighting. Exploring implementations of shader programs, texture mapping, and real-time 3D visualization of meshes, including rendering pipelines, camera controls, and interactive 3D transformations.
